    "1. In my view, a neuron $\\mathcal{N}$ is a pattern attractor, it is parametric with $$ \\theta = \\left<w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_n\\right> $$, a tuple that contains finite elements. It attracts patterns with the condition like:  $$ \\sigma(\\theta, x) \\in (0, 1] $$, in which $\\sigma$ is attraction function. In my experiment, I set it as $$\\sigma(\\theta,x)=\\tau(\\theta\\cdot x)$$. $\\tau$ is the activation function, it satisify: $$\\tau(x|\\alpha) \\in [0,1]$$, in which $\\alpha \\in (-\\infty,+\\infty)$ is the parameter for activation function $\\tau$. We limit the signal to be between 0 and 1(both of margins can be reached). Simplest case is, $$ \\tau = \\min(1,\\max(0,x+\\alpha)) $$\n",

    "2. For any of the neuron in a neural system, it will be affected by other ones in two manners by both cooperation and competition, firstly the cooperation, the closer the stronger: $$ \\mathcal{N}_i \\mathcal{N} $$, and secondly the competition, the same theory, the closer the stronger: $$ x $$.\n",
