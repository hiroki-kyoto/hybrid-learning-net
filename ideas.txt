Hybrid Learning Network: 
1. Unsupervisedly learn the trainable sparsity mask matrix
2. Supervisedly learn the trainable weight matrix
3. For each layer, it the sparsity mask matrix is not stablized,
   then go on with such process:
	a.	Supervisedly train weight matrix with small labeled data.
	b.	Unsupervisedly train sparsity mask matrix with big
		unlabeled data.
	c.	if big enough change is made in b, then continue with
		process a->b->c. Exit this process till condition fails.
	[*] Easy to see, if network is stacked with layers, then
		the hybrid training process will be just layer by layer.
